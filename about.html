				<h2>Hi, I am Omary Ally</h2>
				<p>Software are made to simplify our daily activities and make our life easier, join me on my
					journey
					in building solutions.</p>
			</header>
			<p>When I was going to University I knew I want to build solutions in Technology. I didn't have a
				role
				model to look up to and I decided to study other thing I love, Water Engineering and Irrigation.
				I was really
				interested in software used in Water Engineering and Agriculture and I wanted to build solutions
				which can
				have an impact to many people. I decided start my journey in Software Engineering, I studied
				with
				the community and now I can use my knowledge to build solutions.</p>
